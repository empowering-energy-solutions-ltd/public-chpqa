There are 2 brackets that a site may fall under in-terms of their returns on CCL:

- Good Quality - All qualifying input and outputs are considered Good Quality CHP (GQCHP) and scheme is fully qualified, maximizing % return of CCL. Qualifying is equal to the Total.
- Scheme failing - In this case the required threshold is not met, qualifying inputs and outputs are scaled back/reduced reducing % return of CCL. Qualifying is less than Total.
